Compiler Design: CS104- Assignment 1
Write a main program for the language oc that you will be compiling this quarter. Also, include a string set ADT for it, and make it preprocess the program using the C preprocessor. 
The string set will operate as a hash table and have the interface in a file called stringset.h and the implementation in stringset.cpp. 
Compile your hand-coded programs with g++ -g -O0 -Wall -Wextra -std=gnu++14 and make sure that the programs are fixed so that no warning messages are gener- ated.
